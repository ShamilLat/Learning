The article introduces EDPM, an embedded domain-specific language for performance monitoring in C and C++ programs. EDPM is designed to simplify the process of embedding and managing performance monitoring in programs. The goal of EDPM is to provide programmers with a higher level of abstraction for annotating areas of code requiring instrumentation, thus reducing programming effort.

Key benefits of EDPM discussed in the paper include a reduction in the required lines of code and simplification of configuring performance monitoring regions. The authors compare EDPM with the well-known tool PAPI in terms of required lines of code, flexibility in configuring regions, and performance overhead. The study's findings demonstrate that EDPM is a low-resolution profiling tool that offers a reduction in required lines of code and enables programmers to express various configurations of regions.

Overall, EDPM presents a promising solution for simplifying and optimizing performance monitoring in C and C++ programs.
