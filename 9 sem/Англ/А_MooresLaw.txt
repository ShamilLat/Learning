Daniel Etiemble's article explores the evolution and future of digital electronics technologies and computing paradigms in the context of the anticipated end of Moore's Law. Etiemble examines the history of electronics since the 1960s and assesses possible future directions as the observed exponential increase in the number of transistors on integrated circuits reaches its technological and physical limits.

The article discusses key technologies and paradigms, including integrated circuits with bipolar transistors, MOS and CMOS technologies, as well as potential innovations such as quantum computers and new computing paradigms, including graphics processing units (GPUs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and deep neural networks (DNNs). Limitations of current technologies and obstacles to further increases in performance and scalability are also addressed.

The author emphasizes that the future of computing technologies will be determined not only by technical innovations but also by economic and societal factors. Etiemble provides a comprehensive view of the history and potential directions of computing technology, highlighting the importance of innovation and adaptation in an ever-changing technological landscape.
